![Vercel Deploy](https://deploy-badge.vercel.app/vercel/ai3-info)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Project Overview

This project is a simple space pledged gager designed to calculate and display the space pledged on the [Autonomys Network](https://autonomys.xyz). It provides current network details and is part of the [ai3-info](https://github.com/marc-aurele-besner/ai3-info) repository.

### Built with Deno 2

This project was built using [Deno 2](https://deno.com/), a modern JavaScript and TypeScript runtime. Deno provides a secure and efficient environment for running JavaScript applications.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
